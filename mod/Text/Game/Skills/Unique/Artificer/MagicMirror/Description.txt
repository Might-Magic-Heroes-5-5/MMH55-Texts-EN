Every damaging or cursing spell cast by the enemy has a chance to be randomly reflected to some other target, including enemy units.<br><color_default>The chance to reflect the spell is 10% + (Hero Level)*0.5%. If the spell is reflected, the new target is randomly (uniformly) chosen among all other units on the battlefield. The new target can resist the spell, but it won't be reflected again. Mass and area spells cannot be reflected.
