The hero can teach spells to other heroes and learn from them. The hero can also gain spells from magic schools not supported by the guilds of native towns. A random level 3 spell will be gained at level 10 and a random level 4 spell at level 20, but only if the hero has mastered an unsupported magic school at basic level or higher. <br><color_default>Four spells can be gained if both unsupported schools are mastered. The spells will still be gained if this perk or the unsupported school is obtained at a later level. It is possible the hero learns nothing if it already acquired the random spell elsewhere.
