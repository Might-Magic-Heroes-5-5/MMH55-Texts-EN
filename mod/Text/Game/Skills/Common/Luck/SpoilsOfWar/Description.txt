Adventure Skill: Two Imps, Familiars or Vermins will join the hero's army every day, provided that the hero has some of these creatures in his army already and after every battle won, Imps will collect a certain amount of gold and (one random type of) resources.<br><color_default>The amount of resources gained is equal to randomly between 1% and 2% of the total gold cost of the defeated army. Part of it is payed out in a special resource at a conversion ratio of 1/250 for rare resources and 1/125 for Wood or Ore. After a random value of the special resource (which can be zero) is substracted, the remainder is payed out in gold.
