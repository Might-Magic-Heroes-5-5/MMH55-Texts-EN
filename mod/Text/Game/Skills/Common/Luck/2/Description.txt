Increases luck of all creatures in hero's army by 2.<br><color_default>Whenever a luck bonus is triggered the creature does x1.5 damage. If luck is negative the creature does x0.66 damage (1.5 x 0.66 = 1). These numbers will result in an average damage boost of the entire army of ~15% if the hero has 3 luck and ~25% if the hero has 5 luck. If the hero has the critical hit perk those numbers will be ~20% and 33%.
