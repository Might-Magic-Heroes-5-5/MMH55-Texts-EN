Once per combat, this creature can become invisible to the enemy for 2 turns. If the creature attacks anyone, has its path blocked by enemy units or stops on a tile adjacent to a hostile stack it will be revealed. Enemies do not retaliate to the attacks of invisible creatures. No enemy spells or effects (except area ones) will affect an invisible creature (activated ability). Stalkers can only become invisible if at least 9 units are present in the stack when combat starts.
