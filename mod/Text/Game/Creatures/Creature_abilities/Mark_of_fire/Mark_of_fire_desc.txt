This creature has a chance to curse the target with a "Mark of Fire', resulting in all Fire damage suffered by it to increase by 50% for 2 turns. The chance is based on the creature's own Hit Points (HP), considering the entire stack. If the target's HP is lower after the hit those odds are equal to 40% + (5% * (HP/TargetHP)). If the target's HP is higher or equal after the hit those odds are equal to 40% - (5% * (TargetHP/HP)).
