This creature has a chance with every attack to stun the enemy so they won't be able to retaliate and lose their initiative (ATB is set to 0, mechanical creatures are not affected). The chance is based on the creature's own Hit Points (HP), considering the entire stack. If the target's HP is lower before the hit those odds are equal to 40% + (5% * (HP/TargetHP)). If the target's HP is higher or equal before the hit those odds are equal to 40% - (5% * (TargetHP/HP)).
