This creature has a chance of pushing the target one tile aside and cancelling all Initiative the target has accumulated. The chance depends on the number of tiles this creature has moved before attacking. The chance is equal to 1 - ((X/5)^T. In this formula T is equal to the amount of tiles walked and X is the base chance. The base chance is calculated exactly the same as for the Bash ability. Therefore the resulting chance after 6 tiles is similar to Bash.
