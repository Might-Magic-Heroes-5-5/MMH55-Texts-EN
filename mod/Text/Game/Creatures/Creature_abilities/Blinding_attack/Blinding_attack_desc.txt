This creature has a chance with every attack to blind the enemy. The effect is the same as the spell cast with 14 Spellpower. The chance is based on the creature's own Hit Points (HP), considering the entire stack. If the target's HP is lower after the hit those odds are equal to 40% + (5% * (HP/TargetHP)). If the target's HP is higher or equal after the hit those odds are equal to 40% - (5% * (TargetHP/HP)).
