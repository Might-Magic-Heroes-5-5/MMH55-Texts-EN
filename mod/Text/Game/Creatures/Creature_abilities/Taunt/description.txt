This creature has a chance of distracting the enemy, redirecting an attack initially intended for another friendly stack on a neighboring tile, to itself. The chance is based on the creature's own Hit Points (HP), considering the entire stack. If the target's HP is lower before the hit those odds are equal to 40% + (5% * (HP/TargetHP)). If the target's HP is higher or equal before the hit those odds are equal to 40% - (5% * (TargetHP/HP)).
