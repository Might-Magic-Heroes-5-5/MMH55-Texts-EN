This creature can inflict damage from a range. When distance to target is longer than half the arena, the target suffers only half the normal damage. Shooter cannot use ranged attack when blocked by enemy creature, and deals only half the damage in melee (unless it has the 'no melee penalty' ability). If there's no Ammo Cart in the army, the number of shots is limited by available ammo.
