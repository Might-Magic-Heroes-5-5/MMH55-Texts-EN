There is a chance that during a melee attack this creature will use one of the following spells, in addition to inflicting regular damage: Slow, Weakness or Suffering (The spell does not work on undead, elemental and mechanical units). The chance is based on the creature's own Hit Points (HP), considering the entire stack. If the target's HP is lower after the hit those odds are equal to 40% + (5% * (HP/TargetHP)). If the target's HP is higher or equal after the hit those odds are equal to 40% - (5% * (TargetHP/HP)).
