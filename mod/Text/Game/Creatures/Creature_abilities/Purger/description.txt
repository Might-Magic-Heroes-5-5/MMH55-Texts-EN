This creature has a chance to remove a positive effect from any enemy it attacks. The chance is based on the creature's own Hit Points (HP), considering the entire stack. If the target's HP is lower after the hit those odds are equal to 40% + (5% * (HP/TargetHP)). If the target's HP is higher or equal after the hit those odds are equal to 40% - (5% * (TargetHP/HP)).
