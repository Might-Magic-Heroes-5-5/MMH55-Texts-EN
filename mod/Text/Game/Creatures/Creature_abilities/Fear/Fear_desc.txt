There is a chance enemies attacked by this creature panic and try to run to the edge of the arena, losing all initiative accumulated (Doesn't affect creatures immune to Mind-related spells). The chance is based on the creature's own Hit Points (HP), considering the entire stack. If the target's HP is lower after the hit those odds are equal to 40% + (5% * (HP/TargetHP)). If the target's HP is higher or equal after the hit those odds are equal to 40% - (5% * (TargetHP/HP)).
