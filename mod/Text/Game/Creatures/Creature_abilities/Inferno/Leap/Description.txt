This creature can leap on any enemy target, at great distance, getting attack bonus of 10% + 10 % for every tile it goes over. After the leap, the demon lands on the tile next to the target, and is exposed to retaliation 50% more powerful + 5% more for every cell it leaps (additive). The leap can't be longer than 7 tiles, and it can't be shorter than 3 tiles (activated ability).
