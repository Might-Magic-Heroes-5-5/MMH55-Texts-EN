This creature has a chance to put an enemy into deep slumber for a little longer than one turn. The sleeping enemy is not able to move or attack until it wakes up or it is attacked. Moreover, it gets maximum damage from the Vampire Prince’s attack and it does not retaliate to the attack that wakes it. (Doesn't work on Undead, Mechanical or Elemental creatures). The chance is based on the creature's own Hit Points (HP), considering the entire stack. If the target's HP is lower after the hit those odds are equal to 40% + (5% * (HP/TargetHP)). If the target's HP is higher or equal after the hit those odds are equal to 40% - (5% * (TargetHP/HP)).
