This creature has a chance to frighten a target and its neighbors by the attack. In the event of success the attacker gets +1 to it's Morale and +10% to it's Health for 2 turns. The chance is based on the creature's own Hit Points (HP), considering the entire stack. If the target's HP is lower after the hit those odds are equal to 40% + (5% * (HP/TargetHP)). If the target's HP is higher or equal after the hit those odds are equal to 40% - (5% * (TargetHP/HP)).
