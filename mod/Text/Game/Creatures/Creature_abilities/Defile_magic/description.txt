The Witch Doctors have a certain chance of defiling the spells cast by their targets (Casters only), either weakening them (40%), increasing their cost (40%), or making them fail (10%). This defilement has a chance to backfire (10%), duplicating a negative spell effect on the unlucky Goblins. Against a hero the above % only apply if the Goblin Stack size = (Hero level + Spell level) * 25. Otherwise those chances are increased or decreased by 5% for every 25 missing or additional Goblins.
