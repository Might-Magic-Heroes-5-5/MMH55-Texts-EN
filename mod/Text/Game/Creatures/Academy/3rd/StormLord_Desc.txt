Unconcerned by worldly matters the Colossi are gifted with God-like powers. At their command entire battlefields may be consumed by fierce storms. Woe be it to any who should find themselves the victims of their elemental fury, as lightning bolts strike down those at the heart of the storm, while wild gusts of wind sweep the bowmen's arrows off course.
