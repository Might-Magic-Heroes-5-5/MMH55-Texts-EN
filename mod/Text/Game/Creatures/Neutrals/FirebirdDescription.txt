In his treatise “On the Nature of the Spirit World”, the great scholar Sar-Aggreth made a tentative classification of Spirits. He noticed that greater Spirits often took the form of majestic birds. It is therefore no surprise that when Wizards of House Anima tried to materialize the most powerful energies of the Plane of Magic, the resulting beings looked like majestic eagles of pure mana. It took a long time (and many disastrous failures) before the Wizards were able to understand the nature of this powerful being and bend it to their wills.
