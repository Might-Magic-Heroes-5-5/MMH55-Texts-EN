Elleshar is a middle-aged elf druid who seldom jokes or smiles, renowned for his extensive magic prowess. Having reached his position and expertise without any natural gift or exterior help, he believes in hard work and self reliance, and is more than willing to impose those principles upon anyone who would come to ask him for guidance. When the natural order is endangered though, he is eager to lend a hand to whoever he deems most likely to protect it.
