Gem never knew her parents: abandoned as an infant in the middle of a forest, she was found and adopted by local pixies, who raised her as their own. As a result, she grew into a particular connection with the nature and forest spirits, that allowed her to assume a pecular position as an elven sorceress who didn't follow any of the traditional rites of passage, yet proved more than once that she was as much a fervent protector of the forest as any other druid. On the downside, blending into the elven society is a constant struggle for her, since she never got the opportunity to get used to consume cooked food, walk on roads, or wear actual clothes.
