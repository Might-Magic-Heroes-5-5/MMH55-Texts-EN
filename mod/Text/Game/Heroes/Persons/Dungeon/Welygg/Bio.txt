Welygg is one of the youngest Dark Elf commanders, having been born after his people’s exile to the underground realm. His parents believed the birth of their son was a good omen for the future, and so they gave him a name that can be translated as “Underground Spring”. Unfortunately, Welygg’s parents were later killed during a Dwarven assault. Despite the horrors he had to witness during the war, Welygg has always kept a cheerful and optimistic view on life. This had made him a popular leader, especially among the younger generation of Elves.
