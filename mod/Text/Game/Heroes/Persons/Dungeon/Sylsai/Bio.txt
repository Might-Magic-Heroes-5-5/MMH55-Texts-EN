Younger brother of Raelag and twin to Menan, Sylsai is the current leader of the Soulscar clan. He was always the most "hot-headed" of Tuidhana's sons. He respects his brothers but believes they are slow to act. He strongly dislikes Humans and Sylvan Elves, finding it impossible to forgive their behaviour during the War of the Bitter Ashes and the Day of the Tears of Fire, conflicts that led to the Dark Elves' exile. During the wars against the Dwarves, emissaries from Kha-Beleth approached him to form an alliance. He rejected him at the time. But the gruesome War Under the Mountain took its toll on both his body and sanity. He now thinks the Dark Elves should join the Demons and enjoy the tremendous chaotic powers offered by Urgash. He truly believes that he is destined to leave the Dark Elves.
