Yrbeth was a child gifted with powers of focus and concentration beyond her years.  Training in the eldritch arts like many of her kin, Yrbeth's ability to focus her powers - famously displayed during an earthquake - permits her to accumulate more magical energies than is normally possible.  The night before an important battle Yrbeth often goes sleepless, spending hours in meditation to prepare herself.
