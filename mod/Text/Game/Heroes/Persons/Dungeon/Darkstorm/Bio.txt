Back when he was a slave in Al-Rubit, Darkstorm made sure nobody would be aware of his arcane abilities. Under a mask of obedience, he used every opportunity to observe his Wizard masters, slowly learning their craft. When he had learned enough, he murdered them with the very Magic they believed was their prerogative. His reputation preceding him like the dark clouds before a thunderstorm, Darkstorm recently traveled to Ygg-Chall to lead his Minotaur brethren.
