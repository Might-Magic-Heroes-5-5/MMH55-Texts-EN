Rissa is one of the few brilliant minds that fashioned and improved the design of titans as the Seven Cities know them today. A less known fact about titans is that creating one takes up a fraction of the soul of their creator, and Rissa has manufactured a lot of them, which has left her quite depleted for a time. On the other hand it also allowed her to perfect her techniques for balancing and nourishing a healthy soul, something few mages master, and she is ready to teach it to her peers so that they don't repeat her mistakes.
