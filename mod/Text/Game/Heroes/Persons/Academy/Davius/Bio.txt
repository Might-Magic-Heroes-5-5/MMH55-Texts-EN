Born to a poor family in the Seven Cities, and without an outstanding magical talent, Davius had little hope for his future, and counted himself lucky when he entered the service of a renowned mage as a workshop assistant. Alas, the wizard proved to be a harsh and cruel master, never shying away from inflicting pain over those who would displease him, but Davius knew that resisting would only make his situation worse. One day though he witnessed his master dispensing a terrible magical punishment over one of his rakshasa servants, and seeing the proud creature tortured this way strengthened his resolve. While the wizard was focused on maintaining his spell, Davius struck him from behind, killing him with a single blow, and fled the building with the rakshasa he rescued. They later became close friends, and Davius gained an unusually good reputation among the Seven Cities rakshasa community, which opened many unexpected opportunities to him. As for his crime, his guilt was never found out by the authorities, and any proof they thought they had just seemed to vanish.
