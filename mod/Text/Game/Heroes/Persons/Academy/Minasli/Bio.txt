Minasli was the type of child who takes things apart to find out how they work. Studying magic was a slow process for her because she was more interested in deconstructing spells than learning new ones, much to her tutors' annoyance in the Seven Cities. She ended up expelled from courses for her lack of progress in the main subjects, and started a small job helping as an arcane assistant at a local engineer's shop. Unexpectedly, this is when her actual talent shone: in a matter of days she applied the basics of enchantment she learned in the academy in a different way from what was taught to multiply the efficiency of any engines she touched. In the following months she became renowned as the next Seven Cities magical engineering prodigy, and her old tutors cursed the day they got rid of her.
