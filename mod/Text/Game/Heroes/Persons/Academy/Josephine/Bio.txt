While most wizards, even among those who travel, tend to cling to cities, to study magic with other practitionners, Josephine has always been a wanderer and an explorer. To her opinion, there is as much knowledge to be found in old ruins and arcane places of power as there is among other mages, and she has never been a lover of talking to people for days long. She has already uncovered immense mysteries on her travels, and she intends to find way more before she passes away. The only thing she dreads about exploring is the moment she comes back to the Seven Cities, and the whole magical community seems to assail her with questions about her latest discoveries.
