Malustar is an ancient pit lord born among the first demons created by Urgash. The name he gives everyone is not the one he was born with, for that name is unpronounceable. He deeply believes that imprisonment is slowly draining the essence of his kin, and pledged allegiance to Kha-Beleth seeing that he was bent on ending this banishment. While few other demons believe in Malustar's ideas, those who do are especially eager to join his ranks to escape a terrible fate.
