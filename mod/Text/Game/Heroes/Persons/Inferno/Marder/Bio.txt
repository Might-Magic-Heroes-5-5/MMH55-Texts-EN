Marbas has been the iron-fisted leader of the demon cult in the Silver Cities for many years. Hated by the renegade Mages he dominates, Marbas studied deeply in their arts out of both curiosity and self-preservation - should his underlings turn against him, Marbas wanted to be able to use magical summons. He is second only to the Demon Sovereign in his ability to field arcane troops.
