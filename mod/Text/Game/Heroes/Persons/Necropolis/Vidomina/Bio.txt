At a young age, Vidomina showed promise as a great alchemist, but was driven from the Seven Cities when it was discovered that she had been using her skills not to animate inanimate matter, but to attempt to bring life to previously living creatures, which bordered too much with the forbidden art of necromancy. Unsurprisingly, Vidomina found refuge in the border towns of Heresh, where she could pursue her experiments in relative peace. As her research didn't bear any spectacular fruit, she ended up practicing the more traditional forms of necromancy, and her experience with alchemy came in particularly handy while imbuing corpses with the particular kind of magic necessary to create liches.
