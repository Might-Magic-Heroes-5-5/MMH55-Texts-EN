No one is really sure how long Thant has roamed Ashan. Some say he was among the first mages to devote themselves to the dark aspect of Asha. Others believe he practiced some stranger form of necromancy even before. Thant himself is known for his secrecy and was never willing to give answers to anybody, but one thing is certain: he is a skillful master of the undead, knowledgeable in rituals that remain secret even to the most powerful necromancers.
