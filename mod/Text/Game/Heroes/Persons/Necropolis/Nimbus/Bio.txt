When Nimbus was a child he had a cat that eventually died of old age. Nimbus discovered that, by sacrificing a small animal such as a bird or a mouse, he could resurrect his pet, a feat which he repeated each time the cat died. Little did he realize that he was already exploring a strange natural talent he had for Necromancy. After he has been sought after by Necromancers who had heard tales of his exploits, he has been properly schooled in the art of creating and controlling undead, but it is said that in truth he taught his mentors as much as they taught him. Now an old and experienced Necromancer, his wisdom is respected everywhere in Heresh, but he is still rarely seen without a skeletal cat following him.
