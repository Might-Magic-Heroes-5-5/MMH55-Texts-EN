Vaniel was the predecessor of King Alaron and the son of the High Elven King Arniel. After Brythigga, the mother of Trees, sacred to the elves, was consumed by fire, Vaniel blamed the Dark Elves and gave them an offer of exile or death. Most of them choose exile; the rest were hunted down and destroyed without mercy.
