Arkath the Dragon of Fire favours Brand, a sombre and unsociable Warlord whose face is hidden by a red cloth. It is rumoured that, in his youth, Brand made a mistake when experimenting with the Runes and suffered terrible scorches. This accident, however, did not deter him from continuing his studies. It is for his persistence and devotion that Arkath blesses him, rewarding him with supernatural ability in Fire Magic.
