Born to the Stronghammer clan, Bart Brimstone was always a curious and independant fellow. Initially apprenticed to an artisan, he showed a surprising gift for elemental magic, and was left to the care of the local temple of Arkath. After a mere year though, Bart was expelled from the temple because of 'conflicting ideas', as he calls it. In truth he shared none of the priests' devotion to Arkath and was content with learning magic on his own, without any kind of dogmatic supervision. Since then he has been travelling across dwarven lands, as well as outside of them, searching for ways to further his mastery of magic, and maybe earn a coin or two on an odd job that would require his talents.
