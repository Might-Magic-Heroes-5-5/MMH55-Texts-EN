Like the many in the Winterwind clan, Hedwig "Silverhair" Randversdottir actually enjoys venturing far from the comfort of the great stone halls of Grimheim, exploring new lands and meeting new faces. But as a Flamekeeper, she also considers her duty to serve as a spiritual guide and magical expert to other dwarves. While those two aspects of her life may seem hardly compatible, she fulfills them both by providing guidance and support to scouting parties and diplomatical delegations of dwarves from other clans who are less than thrilled at the idea of leaving the safety of their underground homes.
