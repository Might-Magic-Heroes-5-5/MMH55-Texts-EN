Haegeir Mordisson is the current warlord of the Grimsteel clan, but you wouldn’t necessarily suspect it from his cheerful personality. Make no mistake, though: he hasn’t been given the nickname “Bearheart” because of his cuddly disposition. His oldest friend and comrade-in-arms, Hathor the Deepstrider, would tell you Haegeir is a simple man, who likes doing what he does best. In Haegeir’s case, that would be eating, drinking, maiming and killing. His warmongering disposition divides his kin, with some seeing him as a man of action and a boon for the army, and others considering him a brute that will probably cause more wars than the dwarven kingdom can handle. Among his most ardent supporters are the Thanes of his clan, bored by the relative peace of the last decades and itching for a true conflict to put their skills to use.
