Maximus is undoubtedly the last kind of person you would expect to meet in the Stone Halls. Anciently a knight in the Griffin Empire by a strange concourse of circumstances, the dislike of a powerful lord for his kin has led to this orc's exile. Given his history of service among their enemies, he knew he could never join his people in the steppes, so he wandered across Ashan for years, serving as a mercenary for various leaders. During a campaign at the service of Grimheim, his raw blood rage proper to orcs has been noticed by the dwarven berzerkers, who were awed by the way he absolutely loses himself in battle, ends up covered in blood, his and his enemies', yet always lives to tell the tale. Unaccustomed to the warm welcome they gave him, Maximus decided to stay awhile among his latest employers, and ended up forming an unusual friendship with the Grimsteel clan. Stories say that what truly sealed their bond was a drinking contest at the victory celebration held by the clan after the campaign, where even the toughest dwarves ended unconscious on the ground, while Maximus was still happily swallowing pint after pint.
