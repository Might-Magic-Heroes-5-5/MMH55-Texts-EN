Tazar is a brash and ill-mannered young dwarf, but under his rough demeanor hides a brilliant mind. He is esteemed by many to be a genius blacksmith and architect - despite his young age he already managed to improve the quality of the metalwork used in dwarven armors all aroung Grimheim, and his stonecutting techniques are suspected to be more efficient than those used by dwarves for generations. Of course his talent has sparked the envy of other dwarven engineers, but Tazar is confident that his personal guard is more than well equipped to deal with any of his rivals - after all he is the one who outfitted them.
