Malik, a powerful Emir whose lands lie between Al-Rubit and the borders of the Holy Falcon Empire, surprised everyone when, after the Bloodmoon Eclipse, he declared himself a servant of Urgash, the Dragon of Chaos. Extremely wealthy, even for a lord of the Seven Cities, he has financed the works of several Wizards studying the forbidden magic of Chaos. His ambition is motivated by a desire to destroy the civilisation of his peers, whom he claims are decadent and unfocused. The fact that his father nearly lost everything his family owned because of an uncontrollable penchant for gambling explains, in part, his fascination with the Demons of Sheogh, who are the masters of luck.
