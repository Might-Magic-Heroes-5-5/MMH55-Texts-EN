Though Duncan is from an ancient family whose lands (and blood) come from none other than the fabled Falcon dynasty, as a youth his heart longed not for the sumptuous halls of royal palaces but for expanses of sunlit fields, for dusty roads and for the adventures that lay in wait. Impatient with aristocracy and aristocrats, Duncan devoted his life to wandering, and there are few places left in the Kingdom which he hasn’t visited yet.  As one travels for a long time, one is expected to acquire many strange and outlandish skills, and Duncan is no exception to that rule - most notably, he has picked a knack for engineering during the years he spent among dwarves, with his close friend Wulfstan.
