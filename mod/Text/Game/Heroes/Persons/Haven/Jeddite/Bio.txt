After both his parents died from plague, young Jeddite resolved himself to prevent that from happening to anyone else, and began studies as a healer under Elrath's monks. Quickly enough though, he realized that their rules and dogmas were shackling their ability to truly help others, but was banished from the community when he tried to share his views with others. Disgrunted, he wandered the lands of Ashan, learning less conventional methods for healing, such as the herbal remedies of elves or the darker magics of Heresh, but always coming back to the Griffin Empire when the need for healers was the direst, without heeding to the cold welcome he sometimes met with the followers of Elrath.
