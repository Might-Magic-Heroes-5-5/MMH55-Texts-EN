At certain times in Orcish history there have been witches particularly attuned to dark powers inherited from their Demonic ancestors, and Garuna is one of them. Born of a Shaman who was participating in a ritual sacrifice in spite of her advanced pregnancy, she was brought into the world in the midst of a ceremony of bloodletting and intense fervor, and it seems to have granted her a special affinity for unholy magic. The night before a major battle she often retires in her tent with some prisoners, and only emerges the next day covered in blood and crackling with dark energies.
