Born in Stonehelm, Erika started her career as a Wizard-for-hire, and one of the best there was. Four years ago, she was lured to the Free City of Hammer Fall by promises of adventure and riches, and was among the heroes who fought valiantly against an insidious threat that lurked within the city. Her mastery of destruction magic proved her greatest weapon. The rapidity with which she literally incinerated her enemies earned her the nickname of "Flame Strike". During the events that transpired in Hammer Fall, Erika learned that greed leads only to demise. A fellow adventurer, Arrio, convinced her to pledge her magical powers to the service of a greater cause. She followed him to the Pao Islands to assist the Orcs in their fight for freedom.
