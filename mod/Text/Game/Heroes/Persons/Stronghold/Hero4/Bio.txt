Orcs produce few natural leaders, as not only bravery and intelligence but also savagery is required to gain their respect. Gorshak is unusual in this; even other leaders look up to him for the prowess he has shown. During the great drought of the Year of the Fields of Dust he led a loose coalition of seven tribes on a six-month journey through desert, fire, attack by maddened beasts, war with Dwarven renegades, and flash floods. A chief among chieftains, they fight with particular zeal when he leads them.
