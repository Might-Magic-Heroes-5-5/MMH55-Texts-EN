Zouleika is a descendant of the celebrated wizard Agar, creator of many strange beastmen, and she was supposed to inherit his influential position among the Crimson Wizards of Karthal, but she refused to celebrate her lineage and the history of slavery and pain it left behind. Instead, upon completing the first cycle of her studies, she left her family and the Seven Cities behind with the intention of righting the wrongs they have caused in the past. When she first presented herself to the Burning Bone clan offering her services, she has faced hostility and spite, and only the tribe shaman's intervention saved her from a terrible fate. The shaman offered her to prove her intentions and skills by freeing orcs enslaved in several mines of the Griffin Empire, which she accepted readily. Not only she succeeded at her mission, but the havoc she caused in the slaver camps was more than enjoyed by the orcs she freed, and when she came back to the Burning Bone, she was greeted as a liberator, and during the celebration that took place that night the tribe accepted her as one of them and a honorary orc. Since then, she completely adopted their traditions proved on many other occasions that she won't let the mistakes of her ancestors stain Ashan.
