Shiva grew up in the Free City of Stormcliff, but soon understood she was not meant for urban life. In the singing of the birds, in the murmur of the wind, in the growl of the thunderstorm, she could hear the call of Ylath. At twelve, she said her goodbyes (or rather left them on a piece of paper), packed her bags, stowed away in the caravan of a merchant, and started a life of adventure. She traveled all around Ashan with a group of fellow adventurers and accomplished many incredible exploits, including raiding the Sunken Temple, finding the Dragon Utopia, and surviving the deadly traps of the Tomb of a Thousand Terrors. Currently, Shiva resides in the Pao Islands with the Orcs, learning from their Shamans the secrets of the one they call Father Sky. Not one to sit still for a long period of time, she intends to go looking for the lost peak where the legendary Thunderbird dwells.
