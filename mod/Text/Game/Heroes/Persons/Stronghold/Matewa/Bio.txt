Trusted, if not religiously revered, by the warriors of his tribe, Matewa is young in years and ancient in wisdom. This Orc Shaman is said to have heard the angry voices of the ancestors in his fist infant dreams. Matewa had completed his initiatory dreamwalk by the age of six and wears no twisted or mutated marks from the experience, save a lightning-shaped scar that crosses his whole chest. A brilliant orator and clever joker, Matewa wields the wisdom of thousands of Orc warriors and hundreds of shaman storytellers. He often jests that he'll be rid of their complaining the day the Orcs rule all of Ashan.
