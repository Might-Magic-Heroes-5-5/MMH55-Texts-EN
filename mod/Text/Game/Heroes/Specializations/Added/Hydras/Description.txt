Hydra Tamer: At the start of combat, a stack of friendly Hydras, Deep Hydras or Foul Hydras will use the Dash ability, doubling their initiative for 3 turns (the stack must be larger than one unit). Furthermore, at the start of each week more will be available for recruitment in all owned Dungeon towns. The amount is equal to 0.1*hero level. There are no extra creatures available before level 5.
