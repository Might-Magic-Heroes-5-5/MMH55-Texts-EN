Goblin King: At the start of combat all Goblins, Goblin Trappers and Goblin Witch-Doctors will get to act immediately. Furthermore, at the start of each week more of such creatures will join the hero's army (provided that some of these creatures are present). The amount is equal to 1.6*hero level. The amount is boosted by 75% for every additional town captured of the same faction as the hero.
