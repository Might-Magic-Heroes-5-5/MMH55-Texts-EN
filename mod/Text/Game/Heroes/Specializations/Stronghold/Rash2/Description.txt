Tracker: The hero gains -5% terrain penalty for every level and +1% movement points for every three levels. The Mage Guild also summons Wolves instead of Water Elementals and the hero starts with 12 Dragonblood Crystals for the purpose of summoning them. The Mage Guild doesn't swap creatures if the hero wasn't present on the map on day one or hired from a tavern.
