Zombie Lord: At the start of combat, a stack of friendly Zombies, Plague Zombies or Rot Zombies will use the Dash ability, doubling their initiative for 3 turns (the stack must be larger than one unit). All Zombies and upgrades in the hero's army also gain +1 to their Attack and Defence for every two levels of the hero, starting on first level.
