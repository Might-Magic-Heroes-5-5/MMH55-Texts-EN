<body><justify>A Blind Brother, servant of Asha, lives in this observatory. If you are willing to donate 2500 gold to his order, he will change the current week to one that better suits your purpose (The week will change the next day, a 'week of creature X' will retroactively populate town dwellings and the adventure map, but not external dwellings).
