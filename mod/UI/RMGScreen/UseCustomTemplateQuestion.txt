Quick Tips:

-Stick to the indicated map size and player count of the template.
-MMH55_utility.exe will force larger size for water maps, this works well.
-ARMG maps will not work in LAN or Hotseat if scripts are not activated.
-Use Mapmixer utility to activate scripts.
-Process water maps with mapmixer otherwise the waters are very boring.
