If "Town Management" is used when the hero is in non-native castle garrison or dwelling, "Town Conversion" ability may be activated. It allows the hero to convert the town or dwelling faction into to native for the expense of gold and resources. The amount of towns that can be converted will be based on a ratio between the amount of towns and the amount of players on the map. The ratio is calculated as: towns/players+1.
