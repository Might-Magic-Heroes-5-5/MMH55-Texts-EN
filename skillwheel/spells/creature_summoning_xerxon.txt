If Xerxon is chosen as starting hero, any <value2> native heroes that have acquired Dragonblood crystals will allow the Magic guilds of all <value3> native towns owned by the player to summon <value4> creature group to the garrison every week on day 1. The amount depends on the Dragonblood crystals heroes have collected (A) and the experience level of those heroes (B). Formula = SQRT( sum(A*B/<value5>) * (1+Guild level)) rounded to the nearest integer. The amount is zero if no crystals are collected. Creature group moral is neutral.
